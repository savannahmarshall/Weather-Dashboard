# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
This application functions as a weather dashboard that uses a 5 day weather forecast API to retrieve weather data for cities. For the user story, as a traveler, I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that I can plan a trip accordingly. 

While completing this application, I learned how to utilize an API to retrieve data, how to access specific parts of that data and display them in my application and how to create search history that will populate to the webpage. I practiced using the CSS framework Bootstrap for styling and overall layout, using fetch to request data from the API, creating and styling cards with multiple elements using JavaScript and utilizing local storage to store data. Some challenges that I faced were getting the fetch function to access the correct information, getting the local storage functions to work properly and figuring out how to convert the units from celcius to farenheit for the temperature.
