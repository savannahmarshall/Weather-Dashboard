# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
This application functions as a weather dashboard that uses a 5-day weather forecast API to retrieve weather data for cities. As a traveler, you can see the weather outlook for multiple cities to plan your trip accordingly.

While completing this application, I learned how to:

Utilize an API to retrieve data.
Use an API access key.
Access specific parts of the data and display them in the application.
Create a search history that populates on the webpage.
Use the CSS framework Bootstrap for styling and layout.
Use fetch to request data from the API.
Create and style cards with multiple elements using JavaScript.
Utilize local storage to store data.
Some challenges I faced included:

Getting the fetch function to access the correct information.
Getting the local storage functions to work properly.
Figuring out how to convert the units from Celsius to Fahrenheit for the temperature.

## Installation
No installation steps are required for this project as it is a web-based application that runs in the browser.

## Usage
Upon loading this application, you will see a text box in the upper left corner prompting you to enter a city name. After entering your desired city, select the submit button. You will now see a box displaying current weather conditions for that city, including the city name, date, an icon representing the weather conditions, the temperature (in Fahrenheit), wind speed (in MPH), and humidity.

Beneath this box, you will see five dark blue cards representing the 5-day forecast for your selected city. These cards display the same information listed above, minus the city name.

On the left-hand side of the page, your recent city searches are saved. You can select any of these saved cities to see the current and future weather conditions displayed once more. Your search history for saved cities will persist upon page refresh and in local storage.
